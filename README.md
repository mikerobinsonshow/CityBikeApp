# CityBikeApp
This android app aims to eliminate over 6 million dollars in late fees from using Citi Bikes in New York City. 

Citi Bike allows you a full day of rentals for fixed price, however only allows 30-45 minutes per bike. You are allowed to have as many bike rentals per day as you want, as long as you return one bike, and pull out another. 

This app will intelligently map out the most efficient route to your destination using the fewest amount of bike transfers. It takes into account distance, how many bike remain, how many empty slots remain, as well as distance to coffee shops for refueling bikers.

When time is running low, the app will automatically redirect to the nearest bike station with an empty slot. Using this app while using Citi bikes can help save users late fees.
